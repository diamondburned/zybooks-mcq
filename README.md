# zybooks-mcq

Script to bruteforce Zybooks multiple choice questions.

## Why?

Because Zybooks is fucking awful. Could you believe I had to pay $55 for this? I
had to pay $55 to learn something that takes me minutes to learn. It already
takes me a minute to complete each lab assignment; why would I want to bother
going through all these? To top it off, I have to pay full tuition for online
classes. What? Why? What is wrong with this world? How is it this bad? Where did
we go so wrong? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

## Usage

1. Install the script, preferably using ViolentMonkey.
2. Go to Zybooks (or refresh the page).
3. Ctrl+Shift+C.
4. `await doAll()`.

The script will do:

- All multiple choice activities.
- All playback participation activities.
- All matching activities.
- Fill in short answers for you.
	- To submit, add a space, delete the space, then submit.
	- If you don't do that, the page will pretend the entry is empty.
